## slide 1

Hi everyone, I'm Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and I'm here to tell you a bit about rstudio::conf 2019, and specifically the train-the-trainer workshop I'll be giving ahead of the conference.

## slide 2

This is a two day workshop and on the first day I will be joined by my colleague Garrett Grolemund to teach you how to teach short R courses and workshops. On the second day you'll have the choice of choosing between the two tracks: how to teach shiny, which will be taught by me, and how to teach the tidyverse, which will be taught by Garrett.

This workshop is a rare opportunity for those of you who are considering branching out from using R to also teaching R as well as those who already might specialize in teaching R but would like to improve. I'm calling this a rare opporunity as many trainers and educators often go from being practitioners to teachers without training in between about how to teach. This was certainly true for me at the beginning of my teaching career! 

## slide 3

However I've found workshops, books, and other resources on how to teach more effectively to be incredibly helpful for improving my own teaching. Therefore I'm very excited to share what I know about teaching R and Shiny with all of you. I am also super excited about the opportunity to spend two days working with teachers of R!

So what should you expect from the train-the-trainer workshop?

## slide 4

On Day 1 of our workshop we will discuss best practices, pedagogical choices, and tips for creating effective examples and activities. More specifically, we will present practical activities that you can use immediately to improve your presentation style, learning outcomes, and student engagement. The goal is for you to leave the class with a cognitive model of learning that you can use to develop your own effective workshops or courses within your organization. 

## slide 5

Additionally, we will cover how to use RStudio Cloud and its curriculum of tutorials to jump-start your own lessons. 

## slide 6

On Day 2 we will ask you to make a tough choice! Do you want to learn more about teaching Shiny or teaching the tidyverse? 

## slide 7

Those who pick Shiny will join me for a full day of training on teaching shiny at beginner and intermediate levels. Over the past I have developed and taught a variety of shiny courses and workshops, both in person and online. 

## slide 8

We will build on materials from these courses and workshops as well as from the upcoming book on Shiny by Joe Cheng, the creator of the Shiny package, 

## slide 9

and share examples that cover the entire life cycle of a Shiny app:  "build, improve, share". A huge bonus of the workshop is that you will receive the course materials for teaching Mastering Shiny, RStudio's 2-day Shiny workshop. Additionally, participants will receive the RStudio Certified Shiny Instructor certificate.

## slide 10

This workshop is for you if you're a training partner or want to become one, or if you're interested in the certification, or if you are an advocate for R in your organization.

We expect participants to be proficient with Shiny coming into the workshop. 

Please visit the conference website to learn more about my, and others' workshops, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing you all in Austin!
